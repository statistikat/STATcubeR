```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("R/setup.R")$value
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
tmp_cache_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "STATcubeR/open_data") 
dir.create(tmp_cache_dir, recursive = TRUE)
od_cache_dir(tmp_cache_dir)
```

This article explains how and where `r STATcubeR` caches resources from `r ogd_portal` in the local file system.
Understanding this behavior will allow you to enable persistent caches and directly use the cached resources.

## Overview

By default, `r STATcubeR` caches all accessed resources from `r ogd_portal` in the temporary directory of the current R session.

```{r}
od_cache_dir()
```

Let's examine for example what happens when the data from the structure of earnings suvey (SES) is requested.

```{r}
earnings <- od_table("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1")
```

First `STATcubeR` will grab a json with metadata about this dataset from https://data.statistik.gv.at/ogd/json?dataset=OGD_veste309_Veste309_1 and check which resources belong to it. 
For any resource, the attributes `name` and `last_modified` are extracted from the json.
They are also included in the `od_table` object under `$resources`.

```{r}
earnings$resources
```

`last_modified` tells us when the resource was changed on the fileserver.
If a resource does not exist in the cache or if the last modified entry in the json is newer than the cached file, it will be dowloaded from the server.
Otherwise, the cached version is reused.

## Access and Updates

Cached files can be acessed with `od_cache_file()`.
If the specified file exists in the cache, a path to the file will be returned.
Otherwise, the file is downloaded to the cache and then the path is returned.
The files use the same naming conventions as the open data fileserver.

```{r}
od_cache_file("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1")
```

```{r}
od_cache_file("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1", "C-A11-0")
```

To read files from the cache as `data.frame`s, use `od_resource()` with same parameters as in `od_cache_file()`.
This will apply a special parser to the dataset which drops unneeded columns and normalizes column names.

```{r}
od_resource("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1", "C-A11-0")
```

The parser behaves differently for header files, data files and fields.
Json files can be acessed with `od_json()`.

```{r}
json <- od_json("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1")
unlist(json$tags)
```

## Clearing and Changing

`od_cache_clear(id)` can be used to clear the cache from all files belonging to the passed dataset id.
We saw that `earnings$resources` contains 7 rows, therefore 7 files will be deleted during cleanup.

```{r}
od_cache_clear("OGD_veste309_Veste309_1")
```

If you want to use a persistent directory like `~/.cache/STATcubeR/open_data/` for caching, the directory can be changed with `od_cache_dir(new)`. 

```{r}
od_cache_dir("~/.cache/STATcubeR/open_data/")
```

## The resources field

Let's go back to the `$resources` field of `earnings`.

```{r}
earnings$resources
```

We already looked at __`name`__ and __`last_modified`__.
The remaining columns can be interpreted as follows

* __`cached`__ tells us the last time the cache file for the resource was modified.
* __`size`__ is the file size in bytes
* __`download`__ contains the amount of milliseconds used to retrieve the resource when it was last updated.
* __`parsed`__ reports the amount of milliseconds it took `od_resource()` to convert the file contents into a `data.frame()` format.
  For the json file, the parsing time is always reported as <code><span style='color: #BB0000;'>NA</span></code>.

## What's in the cache?

`od_cache_summary()` will give an overview about all files that are available in the cache directory.
The returned table contains one row for every dataset.

- The column **`updated`** contains the last modified date for the datasets json file.
- **`json`**, **`data`** and **`header`** give the file sizes in bytes for the corresponding files.
- **`fields`** is the total size of all fields and **`n_fields`** is the number of classification files available.

We can get a clear picture on how much disk space is used for each dataset.

```{r}
od_cache_summary() 
```

Note that `od_cache_summary()` only gathers information from the local file system based on filenames, `file.mtime()` and `file.size()`.

```{r, include=FALSE}
od_cache_dir(tmp_cache_dir)
```

## Download history

To get a history of all files that have been downloaded from the server, use `od_downloads()`.
For each file, a timestamp for the download is recorded as well as the download time in milliseconds.

```{r}
od_downloads()
```

```{r cleanup, include=FALSE}
unlink(tmp_cache_dir)
```
