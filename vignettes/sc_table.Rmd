  Hands-on guide about transfering data from the STATcube GUI (table view) to R sessions
  via a the download option "open data api request".

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("R/setup.R")$value
```


In the following example, a table will be exported from STATcube into an
R session. This process involves four steps

* create a table with the STATcube GUI (table view)
* download an "API request" for the table (format: `*.json`).
* send the `json` file to the API using `sc_table()`.
* convert the return value into a `data.frame`

It is assumed that you already provided your API key as described in the `r ticle("sc_key")`.

## Create a table with the STATcube GUI

Use the graphical user interface of STATcube to create a table. Visit
[STATcube] and select a database. This will open the table view where you can 
create a table. See the [STATcube manual] for details.

## Download an API request

Choose "Open Data API Abfrage (.json)" in the [download options]. This will
save a json file on your local file system.

It might be the case thatthis download option is not listed as a download format.
This means that the current user is not permitted to use the API.

## Send the json to the API

Provide the path to the downloaded as a string file in `sc_table()`.

``` r
my_table <- sc_table(json_file = "path/to/api_request.json")
```

The object `my_table` is created via the raw API response from `httr::POST()` against the [`/table` endpoint].
Printing the object will summarize the request.
We will demonstrate this with an example json via `sc_example()`.
 
```{r}
(json_path <- sc_example("population_timeseries.json"))
my_table <- sc_table(json_path)
my_table
```

## Convert the response into a data frame

The return value of `sc_table()` can be converted into a `data.frame`.
To do that, use the `$tabulate()` method.

```{r}
my_table$tabulate()
```

This will produce a tidy table, which contains a column for each field of the table.
Furthermore, one column will be present for each measure.

## Further reading

* Functionalities of the returned object are explained in the `r ticle("sc_data")`.
* The `r ticle("sc_table_saved")` shows an alternative way of importing tables.
