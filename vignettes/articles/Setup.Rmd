Instructions for the first-time use of `STATcubeR`.

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from github using the
`remotes` package.

``` r
remotes::install_github("statistikat/STATcubeR")
```

## Adding an API key

In order to use the REST API of STATcube it is necessary to provide
an API key. If your STATcube account is configured to use a key,
the following address can be used to view your key

```
http://sdbext:8081/statistik.at/ext/statcube/jsf/preferences/editPreferences.xhtml
```

To make the key available to `STATcubeR`, use the function
`sc_key_set()`. Replace `"XXXX"` with your key.

```r
sc_key_set("XXXX")
#> The provided key will be available for this R session. Add
#>
#>   STATCUBE_KEY=XXXX
#>
#> to your .Renviron to set the key persistently
```

## How do I get an API key?

Currently, the api is only available inside the firewall of statistics austria.
Therefore, api keys can only be requested by our employees. Api access for
external users with a statcube subscription is planned for spring 2021. Please
get into contact with the package maintainers of `STATcubeR` for details.
