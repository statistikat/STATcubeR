The function `sc_table_custom()` allows you to define requests against the `/table` endpoint programmatically.
This can be useful to automate the generation of `/table` request rather than relying on the GUI to do so.
The function accepts the four arguments.

- A **database** id
- ids of **measures** to be imported (type `MEASURE`, `STAT_FUNCTION` or `COUNT`)
- ids of **fields** to be imported (type `FIELD` or `VALUESET`)
- a list of **recodes** that can be used customize fields

## Building a Custom Table Step by Step {#step-by-step}

The first part of this Article will showcase how custom tables can be
created with a [database about tourism](`r sc_browse_database("detouextregsai")`).
This database will also be used in most other examples of this article.

### Starting Simple {#database}

First, we want to just send the database id to `sc_table_custom()`.
This will request only the mandatory fields and default measures for that database.
In case of the tourism database, a table with one single row is returned.

```{r}
database <- "str:database:detouextregsai"
x <- sc_table_custom(database)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

We see that `r format(x$tabulate()[[2]], big.mark = " ")` nights were spent in Austrian tourism establishments in the month of `r x$tabulate()[[1]]`.

### Adding Countries {#field}

Now we want to add a classification to the table.
This can be done by getting the database schema and showing all classification fields.

```{r}
tourism <- sc_schema_db(database)
(fields <- sc_schema_flatten(tourism, "FIELD"))
```

If we want to add "Country of origin" we need to include the fourth entry of the `id` column in our request.

```{r}
x <- sc_table_custom(tourism, dimensions = fields$id[4])
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

Alternatively, we could also pass the schema object for "country of origin".

```{r}
origin <- tourism$`Other Classifications`$`Country of origin`
x <- sc_table_custom(tourism, dimensions = origin)
```

### Adding Tourism Communes {#fields}

The `dimensions` parameter in `sc_schema_custom()` accepts vectors of field ids.
Therefore, we can add the communes easily.

```{r}
x <- sc_table_custom(tourism, dimensions = fields$id[c(2, 4)])
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

### Add Another Measure {#measure}

Currently, the table only returns the default measure for the database which is the number of nights spent.
We can add a second measure by again using the database schema and passing a measure id

```{r}
(measures <- sc_schema_flatten(tourism, "MEASURE"))
```

We can add both measures to the request by using `measures$id`.
Just like the `dimensions` parameter, the `measures` parameters accepts vectors of resource ids.

```{r}
x <- sc_table_custom(tourism, measures = measures$id,
                     dimensions = fields$id[c(2, 4)])
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

### Changing the hierarchy level {#hierarchy}

We can see in [the GUI](`r sc_browse_database("detouextregsai")`) that "Country of origin" is a hierarchical classification.
If we look at the table above, only the top level of the hierarchy (Austria, Germany, other) is used.
This can be changed by providing the the value-set that corresponds to the more granular classification of "country of origin"

```{r,fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo=FALSE, fig.alt="hierarchical_classification.png"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hierarchical_classification.png")
```

The different value-sets for "country of origin" can be compared by browsing the database schema.

```{r}
(valuesets <- tourism$`Other Classifications`$`Country of origin`)
```

We can see that the two levels of the hierarchy are represented by the two value-sets.
The value-set "Herkunftsland" uses 3 classification elements and represents the top level of the hierarchy (Austria, Germany, Other).
The value-set "Country of origin" uses 87 (10+8+69) classification elements and is the bottom level of the hierarchy.
For classifications with more levels of hierarchies, more value-sets will be present.

We will now use the id for the first value-set in the `dimensions` parameter of `sc_table_custom`.

```{r}
x <- sc_table_custom(
  db = tourism,
  measures = measures$id,
  dimensions = valuesets$`Country of origin`
)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

It is possible to use a mixture of value-sets and fields in the `dimensions` parameter.

## Using Counts {#counts}

Instead of Measures and Value-sets, it is also possible to provide counts
in the `measure` parameter of `sc_table_custom()`.

```{r}
population <- sc_schema_db("debevstand")
(count <- population$`DatensÃ¤tze/Records`$`F-BEVSTAND`)
x <- sc_table_custom(population, count)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

## Recodes {#recodes}

Data can be filtered on the server side by using the `recodes` parameter
of `sc_table_custom()`.
This might be more complicated than filtering the data in R but offers some
important advantages.

- **performance** Traffic between the client and server is reduced which might 
  lead to considerably faster API responses.
- **cell limits (user)** Apart from rate limits (see `?sc_rate_limits`),
  STATcube also
  limits the amount of cells that can be fetched per user.
  Filtering data can be useful to preserve this quota.
- **cell limits (request)** If a single request would contain more than 1 million 
  cells, a [cell count error](sc_last_error.html#CELL_COUNT) is thrown.

### Filtering Data {#filter}

As an example for filtering data, we can request a table from the tourism
database and only select some countries for `Country of origin`.

```{r}
origin <- tourism$`Other Classifications`$`Country of origin`$`Country of origin`
month <- tourism$`Mandatory fields`$`Season/Tourism Month`$`Season/Tourism Month`
x <- sc_table_custom(
  db = tourism,
  measures = measures$id,
  dimensions = list(month, origin),
  recodes = sc_recode(origin, list(origin$`Italy <29>`, origin$`Germany <12>`))
)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

This table only contains two countries rather than
`r length(valuesets[["Country of origin"]])-4` so the amount of cells in the
table is also 40 times less compared to a table that would omit this filter.

### Grouping items {#group}

Other options from the [recodes specification] are also available via `sc_recode()`.
It is possible to group items and specify recodes for several classifications.

```{r}
x <- sc_table_custom(
  db = tourism,
  measures = measures$id,
  dimensions = list(month, origin),
  recodes = c(
    sc_recode(origin, list(
      list(origin$`Germany <12>`, origin$`Netherlands <25>`),
      list(origin$`Italy <29>`, origin$`France (incl.Monaco) <14>`)
    )),
    sc_recode(month, list(
      month$Nov.99, month$Feb.00, month$Apr.09, month$`Jan. 22`
    ))
  )
)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

This table contains data for two country-groups and two months.
In this case, the cell values for Germany and the Netherlands are just added
to calculate the entries for Arrivals and Nights spent.
However, in other cases STATcube might decide it is more appropriate
to use weighted means or other more complicated aggregation methods.

### Adding Totals {#totals}

The `total` parameter in `sc_recode()` can be used to request totals for
classifications. As an example, let's look at the tourism activity in the
capital cities of Austria

```{r}
destination <- tourism$`Other Classifications`$`Tourism commune [ABO]`$
  `Regionale Gliederung (Ebene +1)`
x <- sc_table_custom(
    tourism,
    measures = measures$id,
    dimensions = list(month, destination),
    recodes = c(
      sc_recode(destination, total = TRUE, list(
        destination$Wien, destination$`Stadt Salzburg`, destination$Linz)),
      sc_recode(month, total = FALSE, list(month$Nov.99, month$Apr.09))
    )
)
as.data.frame(x)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

We see that there are two rows in the table where Tourism commune is set
to "Total". The corresponding values represent the sum of all Arrivals
or Nights spent in either of these three cities during that month.

### Recoding across hierarchies {#recode-hierarchy}

To use a recode that includes several hierarchy levels, the corresponding
`FIELD` should be used as the first parameter of `sc_recode()`.
For example, a recode with countries and federal states from the "Country of origin"
classification can be defined as follows.


```{r}
origin1 <- tourism$`Other Classifications`$`Country of origin`
origin2 <- origin1$`Country of origin`
origin3 <- origin1$`Herkunftsland (Ebene +1)`
x <- sc_table_custom(
  tourism, measures$id, origin1,
  recodes = sc_recode(origin1, list(
    origin2$`Vienna <01>`, origin3$Germany,
    list(origin2$`Bavaria (beg.05/03) <80>`, origin3$`other countries`))
  )
)
x$tabulate()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
show_json(x)
```

## Typechecks

Since custom tables can become quite complicated, `sc_table_custom()` performs
type-checks before sending the request to the API.
If inconsistencies are detected, warnings will be generated.
See `?sc_table_custom` for a comprehensive list of the performed checks.

```{r}
sc_table_custom(tourism, measures = tourism, dry_run = TRUE)
```

<details>
<summary>Advanced example</summary>

```{r}
sc_table_custom("A", measures = "B", dimensions = "C", 
                recodes = sc_recode("D", "E"), dry_run = TRUE)
```

</details>

If `dry_run` is set to `FALSE` (the default), STATcubeR will send the request
to the API even if inconsistencies are detected.
This will likely lead to an error of the form ["expected json but got html"].

If you get spurious warnings or have suggestions on how these type-checks might
be improved, please issue a feature request to the [STATcubeR bug tracker].
